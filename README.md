# Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a Sentiment Analysis Model designed to classify the sentiment of text data into positive, negative, or neutral categories. The project showcases how natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning can be used to derive actionable insights from textual data.

## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a key tool for understanding customer opinions, feedback, and overall market trends. This project demonstrates how to preprocess textual data, extract meaningful features, and apply machine learning models to predict sentiment.

## Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Tokenization and vectorization
- Implementation of ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- Performance evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of results and insights

## File Structure
- `Sentiment Analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python packages:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk (for advanced text preprocessing)

Install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Sentiment Analysis.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the cells step by step to load data, preprocess it, and train/test sentiment analysis models.

## Data
This notebook requires a dataset of text samples and corresponding sentiment labels. Ensure your dataset is formatted with columns for `text` and `label` or modify the notebook to suit your data structure.

## Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics are used to evaluate model performance:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
Results highlight the accuracy of various models tested and provide visualizations of key insights. Refer to the notebook for detailed explanations and plots.
